# Homebrew formula for coco (npm package `git-coco`).
#
# This lives here as the canonical source. To publish it, copy it into a tap
# repo named `gfargo/homebrew-tap` (file: Formula/coco.rb). Users then run:
#
#     brew install gfargo/tap/coco
#
# Regenerate the url + sha256 on each release with:
#
#     node bin/genHomebrewFormula.mjs            # latest published version
#     node bin/genHomebrewFormula.mjs 0.71.0     # a specific version
#
# Homebrew brings Node along as a dependency, so this is the zero-prerequisite
# install path for users who don't already have a Node toolchain.
